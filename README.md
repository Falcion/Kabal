<!-- About the project -->

### About the project

This class-library is created to make something in casual programming life a little easier than usual: in different ways and in a different spheres.

Of course the needs of programmers are changing, so the project is actively accepting applications and ideas for adding codes to simplify daily work.

And there is why this project exists:

<!-- Reasons of project existing: may be useless but steel needed. -->

- A time of programmer should be focused on creating more interesting solutions: maybe even something like this but in more complicated direction.

- Repeating of the same tasks over and over is boring.

#### Built with

Project doesn't have any unique dependencies but built with:

- [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)

<br />
<p align="right"><a href="#top" title="Back to the top">↺</a></p>

<!-- Getting started -->

### Getting started

Before using this application, read this paragraph so that you wouldn't have unnecessary questions or problems.

#### Prerequisites

<!-- 
    As it said, project doesn't have any unique dependencies.
    But user must know at least minimum that he needs to install.
    As I would call it - informational minimum.
 -->

Before using this application, ensure you met this requirements:

- Initialized .NET project in which you would use this library.
- Any potential version of VS: or any other IDE with .NET support.

#### Installation

Permission is granted for free use in any of your projects.

Guide for installation of source code of the class-library:

1. Clone the repository with any form of application that supports GIT.
2. Put this application in your path of project and define its namespace.
3. Class-library is ready to be used in your project.

<!--
    "VS" actually is «Visual Studio 2019/2022» including RC versions.
    Unfortunately, developer doesn't have access to ReSharper, so-
    there is no context about IDEs like it.
 -->
Installation through «Nuget» with help of VS:

1. Open project in VS.
2. In opened project in hotbar find the «Nuget Package Manager» and start to manage extensions.
3. Write the name of this project in the search bar.
4. Download the latest stable version through the menu and class-library is ready to be used.

If you use a different IDE from VS, read this article: [using new commands in .NET](STACKOVERFLOW).

### Project usage

As it said before - main purpose of this project is to make things easier.

Project currently includes this:

<!--
    Even like about reasons of project existence:
    - Project could be useful if you want to learn some functions.
    - Project doesn't use some hyper intellectual formulas for calculations.
 -->
- Rationalization module: returns a string format and integer value.
- Different calcs of algebra.
- Numbers factorizations.
- And other enormous number of functions.

If you want to use this project in your own, just install it in and reference it as namespace: nothing special.

    ROADMAP of the project
        List of potential functions in future versions of project: no garanties
 -->
### Roadmap

- [ ] Write a converter module.
- [ ] Write a markdown machine — pasting HTML as MD and backwards.
- [ ] Implement new graphs algorithms and other algorithms alike DFS.
- [ ] Write a rationalization of expressions module.
  - [ ] Rationalization to strings
  - [ ] Rationalization to values
- [ ] Module about generating random numbers, strings, objects.
  - [ ] Experimental integration with RANDOM.ORG API.
- [ ] ... different variation of functions: will be written in future.
- [ ] Publish new version of project.
- [ ] Write a changelog.
- [ ] Write a "soft-read" documentation.

### Contributing

Contributions are what make open source community such an interest place to be in - so any form of contribution are greatly appreciated.

If you have a suggestion that will improve this project: fork the repository and create a pull request.

<!-- Guideline for contributions -->

#### Guideline

1. Fork current repository.
2. Clone the repository with help of any client.
3. Make your changes.
4. Stage made changes and push them.
5. Create a pull request.
6. Squash commits for cleaner history.

For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository.

More about it in this article: [synching a one-single file fork](DCT_LINK).
