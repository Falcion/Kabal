### About the project

This class-library is created to make something in casual programming life a little easier than usual: in different ways and in a different spheres.

Of course the needs of programmers are changing, so the project is actively accepting applications and ideas for adding codes to simplify daily work.

And there is why this project exists:

- A time of programmer should be focused on creating more interesting solutions: maybe even something like this but in more complicated direction.

- Repeating of the same tasks over and over is boring.

#### Built with

Project doesn't have any unique dependencies but built with:

- [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)

### Getting started

Before using this application, read this paragraph so that you wouldn't have unnecessary questions or problems.

#### Prerequisites

Before using this application, ensure you met this requirements:

- Initialized .NET project in which you would use this library.
- Any potential version of VS: or any other IDE with .NET support.

#### Installation

Permission is granted for free use in any of your projects.

Guide for installation of source code of the class-library:

1. Clone the repository with any form of application that supports GIT.
2. Put this application in your path of project and define its namespace.
3. Class-library is ready to be used in your project.

Installation through «Nuget» with help of VS:

1. Open project in VS.
2. In opened project in hotbar find the «Nuget Package Manager» and start to manage extensions.
3. Write the name of this project in the search bar.
4. Download the latest stable version through the menu and class-library is ready to be used.

If you use a different IDE from VS, read this article: [using new commands in .NET](STACKOVERFLOW).

### Project usage

As it said before - main purpose of this project is to make things easier.

Project currently includes this:

- Useful algorithms which could be used even in simplest solutions or codes.
- Universal converter of units.
- Rationalization and theoretical math module: probabilities, math functions and etc.
- Pseudo-random generator of different type objects.
- Markdown-machine.

If you want to use this project in your own, just install it in and reference it as namespace: nothing special.

### Roadmap

- [x] Implement new graphs algorithms and other algorithms alike DFS.
- [x] Write a rationalization of expressions module.
  - [x] Rationalization to strings
  - [x] Rationalization to values
- [x] Module about generating random numbers, strings, objects.
- [x] ... different variation of functions: will be written in future.
- [ ] Publish new version of project.
- [x] Write a changelog.
- [ ] Write a "soft-read" documentation.
